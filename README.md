# Team-3-CPSC-219

This is our Othello game for our final project in CPSC 219. 

All the classes for our Othello game for Demo 1 can be found in the "OthelloCompsci219" folder.
In order to play the Othello game on the console, you will need to compile the OthelloConsoleGame and run this file as well. 
A menu is the first thing you should see when running this program.
